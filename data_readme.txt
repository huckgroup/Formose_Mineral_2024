Data necessary to recreate the figures is contained in formose_mineral_peak_data.csv. The concentrations used in the consecutive reaction cycles are contained in the `sample_conditions` column, where each cycle is seperated with a ';'. Experiments were performed as described in the experimental section.
Figure 2a considers the first cycle of MIN004-MIN011. Figure 2b uses all cycles for MIN004-MIN011.
Figure 3a uses the samples with conditions: "Water;DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)" and "CaCl2(10mM),NaOH(25mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)"
Figure 3b uses samples with conditions: "CaCl2(10mM),NaOH(25mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)", "NaOH(25mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)", "CaCl2(10mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)", "NaOH(25mM);CaCl2(10mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)", "CaCl2(10mM);NaOH(25mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)"
Figure 3c uses samples with conditions:"CaCl2(10mM),NaOH(25mM);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)","CaCl2(11.7),NaOH(23.3);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)","CaCl2(17.5),NaOH(17.5);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)","CaCl2(28),NaOH(7);DHA(35mM),FA(50mM)".
